# PWA-3D-WRAPPSHELL
A PWA Template, with 3D power by BabylonJS, a hint of jQuery animation spice, and pure vanilla Wide-Ranging-AppShell. Introducing the VanillaWeb with Wrappables, in a wide-ranging-appshell. Welcome. Ready to get cookin' with Design Patterns? 


# PWA Wrappables

The first wrappable APP PATTERN is called: TITLESCREEN. 

##TITLESCREEN-(PWA-WRAPPABLE)-.

A lot like inheriting from SplashScreen. But also more "TitleScreen evolves from SplashScreen" in a SEQUENCE. Show a lightning quick user-interactive TITLESCREEN. Why???


## PURPOSE

<i>A PWA Wrappable that maintain the highest possible Lighthouse Audit score</i>. Handy. And it opens up a HOST of other patterns. Which was a low-grade-humor pun. PWACampfire all set up. Let's get cookin`. : )

##Ingredients

>Add a single OPEN-BUTTON. 
>DYNAMICALLY-LOAD a BABYLONJS scene into the PWA
>hide the BUTTON.

#EXAMPLE

Isn't that radical? 

###We think so. :)
